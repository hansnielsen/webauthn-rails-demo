# WebAuthn Rails demo application

This demo is part of a [blog post](https://www.stackallocated.com/blog/2019/u2f-to-webauthn/) that describes how to migrate an application from Rails to WebAuthn.

While you'd be best served reading the blog post, the tl;dr is:

1. Try out the app when it only supports U2F (see the tag `u2f-only`)
2. Switch U2F signing to WebAuthn (see the tag `sign-with-webauthn`)
3. Migrate the database to support distinguishing U2F vs WebAuthn (see the tag `db-migration`)
4. Switch registration to WebAuthn only (see the tag `full-webauthn`)

# Running the demo application

These instructions are good for any commit in this repo.

1. Generate TLS certificates:
   ```
   mkcert -install
   mkcert -cert-file config/tls/localhost.pem -key-file config/tls/localhost-key.pem localhost
   ```

2. Run `rake db:migrate`

3. Run `rails s` to start it!
